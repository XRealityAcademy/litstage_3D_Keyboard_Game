  - text: ' It so chanced, that after the Parsee''s disappearance, I was he whom
      the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab''s bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent
      suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards
      the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round
      and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble
      at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.
      Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated
      by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with
      great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over,
      and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day
      and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they
      glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed
      with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked
      me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search
      after her missing children, only found another orphan.'

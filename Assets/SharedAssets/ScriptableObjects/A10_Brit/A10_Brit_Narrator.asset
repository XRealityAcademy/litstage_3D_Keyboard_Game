  - text: 'We sailed northeast, encountering a vast, golden expanse of brit, the
      primary food of the Right Whale. It felt like moving through fields of wheat,
      as Right Whales, unfazed by the Pequod, swam calmly through the brit, their
      jaws acting like filters. Observing these giants, they resembled rocks or islands
      until they moved. '

  - text: "Their presence was both awe-inspiring and unsettling, embodying the sea's
      untamed nature\u2014a relentless, self-consuming force that holds beauty, treachery,
      and a strange parallel to human souls caught between serenity and unknown terrors."

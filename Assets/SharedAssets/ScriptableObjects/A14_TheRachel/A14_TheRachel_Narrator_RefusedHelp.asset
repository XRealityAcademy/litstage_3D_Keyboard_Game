  - text: "The next day, the Pequod encountered the Rachel, whose deck and masts
      were filled with crewmen. Captain Gardiner of the Rachel urgently hailed Ahab,
      asking if he had seen a missing whaleboat. Gardiner explained that, while his
      crew had been hunting whales, Moby Dick had appeared, drawing a fourth boat\u2014his
      fastest\u2014into pursuit. Soon after, the boat vanished, lost in the turbulent
      chase. Now, Gardiner begged Ahab to help search for his son, a young boy aboard
      the missing whaleboat."

  - text: "Moved by Gardiner's desperation but shackled by his own obsession, Ahab
      coldly refused. Gardiner pleaded, reminding Ahab that he too had a child back
      home, hoping to spark a hint of empathy. Yet Ahab remained unmoved, insisting
      he couldn\u2019t delay his hunt even a moment longer. Gardiner, devastated,
      returned to the Rachel, whose frantic movements across the waves betrayed her
      unfulfilled search for her lost crew."

  - text: As the two ships drifted apart, the Rachel continued to comb the sea, her
      movements slow and mournful. Like the biblical Rachel, she wept for her missing
      children, unable to find peace or rest.

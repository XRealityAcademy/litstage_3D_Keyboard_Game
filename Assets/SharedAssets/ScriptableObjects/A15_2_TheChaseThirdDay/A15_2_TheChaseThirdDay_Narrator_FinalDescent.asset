  - text: "The dawn of the third day saw Ahab\u2019s obsession undeterred as he rallied
      his crew to find Moby Dick. Despite an ominous calm and Starbuck\u2019s pleas
      to abandon the hunt, Ahab remained resolute, readying his men and boats for
      the chase. Around noon, Moby Dick was finally spotted, breaching with terrifying
      force. Ahab ordered the boats lowered, and the men rowed hard, only to face
      the white whale\u2019s fury as he charged their boats, snapping oars and hurling
      the crew into the waves."

  - text: "As Ahab closed in, he saw the body of Fedallah, his prophetic companion,
      entangled on Moby Dick\u2019s back\u2014an eerie fulfillment of the prophecy
      of two hearses. Ahab\u2019s rage grew, and he threw his harpoon into the whale,
      shouting curses as it embedded. The whale writhed, and Ahab\u2019s boat was
      tossed, but he clung on, commanding his crew to press forward.\n"

  - text: The Pequod itself was not spared. Moby Dick turned his wrath upon the ship,
      ramming its hull with his massive head, and the Pequod began to sink, drawing
      the crew and ship into a whirlpool. Ahab, refusing to relent, cast one final
      harpoon, but as the line caught and whipped, it entangled him, pulling him
      from the boat to his death.

  - text: 'The sea engulfed the Pequod and all aboard. Only the flag, nailed by Tashtego
      as he sank, and the circling birds above marked where the ship had been. The
      ocean calmed, rolling on as if the Pequod and her crew had never been.

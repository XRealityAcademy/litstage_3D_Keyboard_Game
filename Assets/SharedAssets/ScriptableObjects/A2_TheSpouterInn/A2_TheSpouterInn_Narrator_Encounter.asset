  dialogueLines:
  - text: The night deepens as I ascend the creaking stairs to the chamber I am to
      share with the enigmatic harpooner. Each step seems to echo with the weight
      of anticipation, the wooden boards groaning underfoot like the timbers of a
      ship in a swell. The corridor is dimly lit by a solitary candle, casting flickering
      shadows that dance upon the walls.

  - text: "I thought about slipping out the window, but being on the second floor
      held me back. I\u2019m no coward, but I couldn\u2019t make sense of this head-peddling,
      tattooed stranger, and my confusion turned to fear. "

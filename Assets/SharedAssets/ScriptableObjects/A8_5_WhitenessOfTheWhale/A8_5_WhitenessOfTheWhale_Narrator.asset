  - text: "Moby Dick\u2019s eerie whiteness stirred a primal unease within the crew,
      setting it apart from any ordinary whale. One day, as I pondered this with
      Queequeg, I learned that, for some, white symbolized the afterlife, while to
      others, it hinted at something both pure and terrifying. In the mess hall,
      sailors debated the significance of this ghostly hue, some seeing it as an
      omen, others dismissing it as superstition."

      fa\xE7ade concealing malice. As the Pequod ventured south, I reflected that
      the whale\u2019s whiteness seemed to mirror our deepest fears\u2014a void and
      a mystery that terrified us as much as the creature itself."
